**Submitting Provider Links:**

If you'd like to submit a playlist file for review, please ensure that it adheres to the following criteria.

**1) No untidy grammar** - Channels should use their correct official titles. For example, "Channel 4" should be written as such. No "Channel four" or "CHANNEL 4"

**2) No Duplicate Channels Without Good Reason** - Unless there are regional variants or something similar, there should be no duplicate channels.

**3) No Dead / Shortcut Links** - Playlists should be maintained and updated to a reasonable standard and links should remain online for as long as possible. No weekly/monthly link changes or tinyurl links. We accept direct links only. 

**4) Include Logos** - At least 95% of your channels should include working logo links.

**5) Group Using Regions** - If you intend on supporting multiple regions, please include them all in one file with their respective region names as the group titles as they are listed above in the Readme.

**6) Use the correct format** - the file format should be ".m3u" or ".m3u8" .

7) Head on over to the discussions tab to submit a link! Thank you for your effort and contribution.
